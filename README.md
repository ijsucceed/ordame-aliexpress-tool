# OrdaMe - aliexpress product recommendation tool

OrdaMe will be a Chrome plugin that tells you whether to add a product to your cart or not. But in the meantime, it is currently a command line app entirely written in Python.

I usually purchase Chinese products on aliexpress.com. Aliexpress.com is a global eCommerce site based in China. But one of the biggest issues I face is dealing with fake products. There are thousands of fake sellers selling on the platform; if you are not familiar with their [tricks](https://www.reddit.com/r/Aliexpress/comments/hlk157/common_scams_on_aliexpress_and_how_to_avoid_them/) you may lose your time and money.

Before I buy a product, I have to check the basics like the seller's reputation and followers; the product sold and ratings; and also read the negative reviews to check for delivery issues (a common issue). But doing this takes time and bandwidth - an average of 10 minutes for each product I want to buy.
